# Statistical estimation in physics

This reposistory stores teaching material on statistical methods in physics, and more specifically in cosmology. 

Each sub-directory contains a slide deck in pdf format (although the more up-to-date versions are linked below) and a jupyter notebook where all relevant numerical calculations are presented. 

The slides are also avilable online:
